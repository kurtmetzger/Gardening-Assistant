# Gardening Assistant
This is a web application that assists in managing planting and harvesting dates for home gardeners. Some tasks this application assists in include:
* Allowing users to keep a list of all plants they are planning on growing for the season
* Keeping track of optimal haarvesting and planting dates
* Adjusting planting dates depending on planting zone of user
* Allowing users to explore plants and seeds in in season to plant on current day

This repo also includes a version of a webscraper I made to get this data used for the project from almanac.com called almanacWebScraper.py, as well as the design artifacts created during the planning stages of this application
